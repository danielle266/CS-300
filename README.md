#CS- 300


    - What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The problem that I was solving in this project was the ablility to write code that will display menu of data that include three options for the user to pick. The option will let thhe user load data, display and print data. In this menu the user should be able to load the data such courses that will show the total number of courses. The second option will display the courses with courseId, courseName and prerequisits. The three option users shoulde be able type in the courseId and information about that course will be display. To end this program the user should be able to exit the program. The course also delt with different data model such as vector, Tree and HashTable. I used vector to in my project.
    
    - How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    In the data struction I had to figure what the directions were asking for and how could I be chose a option for it. For example in my struction I chose to use courseId instead of courseNumber. This will help the user idenifty the course faster and easier. Data struction are important because it allow you to show what you are looking for in the the program and how to identify it.

    
     - How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I tried to break each step to figure out what i needed to do. I also use the tutor aid that help me understand what I was doing wrong and how to proceed. 
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    My work on this project has help me understand coding a little bit more. I stil have much to learn from coding and will continue to take notes and use what I have learn for the next course.
    
   - How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The way I write program is simple and I am working getting better out write and understand the process of codeing. It takes a little time and patience to be able to write comfortably.
